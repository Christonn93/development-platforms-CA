## Introduction

![Azure DevOps offerings](https://veritis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/azure-devops-offerings.jpg)
*Source: google*

Azure DevOps was initially released in 2018 by Microsoft. It is a set of developer tools, services, and features that enable teams to plan, develop, test, and deliver software more effectively. Azure DevOps integrates with the broader Azure cloud computing platform, enabling users to take advantage of its features and services, such as continuous integration and deployment, and virtual machines. Azure DevOps has since become one of the leading development platforms and is widely used by development teams across the world.

Azure DevOps is for the most part free to use, however there is some limitations with using only the free tier options. I will go in deeper details about the pricing [here](#pricing)

## Brief History

In 2005 the service that we today refer to as Azure DevOps was named Team Foundation server(TFS). It was released as a set of development tools and services for teams building software applications. After its release in 2005 it have evolved and expanded with new features and services and have quickly become the most popular development platforms fro Microsoft-centric teams. TFS has been around for more then a decade, and it have since its inception in 2005 evolved a lot. There are professionals in the industry whose entire careers have been dedicated to managing TFS. Such expertise has been necessary because it was quite complicated to administer.

In 2012, TFS morphed into a tool that helped teams manage their software development projects using Agile.

The name "Azure DevOps" came in 2018. Microsoft rebranded TFS to Azure DevOps, this reflecting Microsoft shift to a cloud based service and its focus on providing organizations with a more comprehensive set of tools and services.

After the rebranding Azure DevOps has continued to evolve and add more features, you can read more about the features [here](#features). Azure DevOps have also integrated other Azure services such as Azure functions, Azure Container and Azure Kubernetes service.[[2](#references)]

## Features

## Strengths

Easy to integrate with GitHub. In 2018 Microsoft bought GitHub for $7.5 billion, so the connection between the popular code-repository service used by many developers and large companies and Azure DevOps is really easy to setup and use. The boards that Azure provide have more options to offer and looks better then in the project boards that Github provides. So to be able to use the boards that Azure DevOps offer combined whit Github repo is great.

## Weaknesses

There are some weaknesses whit Azure DevOps, like any software platforms.

One of the weakness is the cost for larger organizations that needs additional service and support, or have really large teams. It's also a bit complex to the new DevOps, so there might be a steep learning curve to be able to use Azure DevOps and to be able to use all that is available. Also, if you are new to the system of Azure DevOps, it can come across as a bit confusing or cluttered when it comes to the user experience.

Azure DevOps is highly customizable, but this can lead to a lack of standardization across projects and teams, making it more difficult to manage and maintain the platform.

## Pricing

The pricing of using Azure DevOps depends on the size of your team or organization. The image below will show you the pricing model that Azure DevOps have.

As you can see in the image above there is a wide range fo options to choose from when it comes to the services that Azure DevOps have to offer.

The basic plan

### Support

There is also a option for premium support from Azure DevOps.
The cost of premium support for Azure DevOps varies based on a number of factors, including the level of support required, the number of users, and the level of service desired.

Microsoft does not publicly disclose the exact cost of its premium support plans for Azure DevOps, as the pricing is customized for each organization based on its specific needs and requirements. To obtain an accurate estimate of the cost of premium support for Azure DevOps, organizations should contact Microsoft directly to discuss their specific needs and requirements.

It is worth noting that while premium support may have a higher upfront cost than basic support, it can provide organizations with a number of benefits, including faster response times, dedicated support engineers, and access to a wider range of support resources and expertise, which can help to minimize downtime and ensure that any issues are resolved quickly and effectively.
